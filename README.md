## Data cleaning and duplicaets detection
This file contains :
- Data Cleaning:
1.Remove non-english words
2.Remove html-tags (try to do it with regular expression, or play with beautifulsoap library)
3.Apply lemmatization / stemming
4.Remove stop-words

- Duplicates detection using LSH

## Quora duplicates detection
The task in this file isbuild an LSTM-based siamese homework and search for the duplicates in quora question pairs dataset.

## Attention mechanism and Bert
The task in this file is to create attention mechanism with the numpy tool. And use of pre-trained models for text processing.

## Fine tuning
The task in this file is to divide documents on 10 topic categories using Huggingface Datasets library.
